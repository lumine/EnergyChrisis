The following resources are harder to get because they require technology to obtain.  You will not find them while mining.

oil:  use Immersive Engineering biodiesel
tungsten: only in mineral deposits under the bedrock see the Immersive Engineering  Core Sample Drill
fuel: to fuel a rocket pump biodiesel into a Magneticraft refinery
silicon ore: Check NEI you can make raw silicon in an arc furnace
plastic: use a Magneticraft polymerizer
osmium: use Galacticraft to mine the asteroid belt for titanium chunks and grind them in a Immersive Engineering grinder
